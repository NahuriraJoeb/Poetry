Hey, I have been thinking about you lately.
I thought when all is done all is done, 
But guess what ?
I still think about you.
Even when i try so hard not to.
I stare at the sky and ask myself,
Is this life worth living.

I sometimes forget.
That as the others promise themselves heaven,
Mine is here.
And not having you in it is really not what i want.

Sometimes your moody, other times just stubborn.
But I like you that way.
Because i carry it at the back of my mind that 
You my lover, my better-half, the apple of my eye.
Has no idea what i really going on.

Man has come far from the trenches of believing that 
He is more superior than nature and has to bend it to his will.
And has tried to live with nature and obey it.

For me when i look at you i see nature,
Its an ending beauty,
It even shines in chaos, see the trees bend to the wrath of the winds.
As the sun shines and enables sockets of water to view the light blue gists of unending creating.
Even with all this man wants to think that he has a better place to live.

When i was young i wanted to make money and order people around.
But as i have grown i have learnt to stay in my lane and stare at nature do its will.
I am not here and going somewhere else after here.
All i know is am here and its where i will be when others assume i am in a better or worse place.

Its just flare.
The lights come on and show the genius in man.
Even when the sun visits another place this place is left with a little life.
One that can chase the fear and have the confidence burn endlessly in man.
It is man who evolution betrayed showed the secrets to which he conforms to defeat it.
So dramatic how he thinks he can win.

But you for you, 
I can stand be me be the provider am meant to be.
Be the man who protects, provides and fights for you.
I know you are strong, 
But we all know its me that carries the masculinity.
I bare it not to harm you but to protect you to support you.
I wish we could come to an understanding.
